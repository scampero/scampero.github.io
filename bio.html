<h3> Sabina Campero </h3>
<h3> Short bio </h3>

<p>My name is Sabina Campero; I am currently a senior at Tufts University studying Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. I was born and raised in La Paz, Bolivia and came to study in the US after graduating from high school. The reason why I chose Mathematics as my major is because I believe that math teaches me how to think and how to solve problems methodically in a very logical and structured way. This is a skill that I have acquired and have been able to use in other areas of study, in my summer jobs and in life in general.</p>
<p>I currently work as a tutor in the Academic Resource Center at Tufts University. I teach math classes including intro to calculus through calculus 3 among others. I have been tutoring since my sophomore year and I really enjoy it, because I love teaching. My first summer in college I went back to Bolivia and I interned at company called Southern Lumber and Veneer. The company was on the verge of defaulting on its debt and was restructuring its loans. I was involved in the preparation of financial projections and assisted the team in negotiating the covenants of the restructuring. My second summer I did an internship in a boutique investment bank based in New York called The Williams Capital Group. During this internship, I was involved in the underwriting of equity and equity-related transactions as well as municipal debt securities. Finally, over the last summer I worked at a company based in San Francisco called Clean Power Finance. I worked as a financial Summer Analyst in the Renewable Capital Markets team and among my tasks I had to model fund's capital deployment schedule and analyzed different return scenarios.</p>
