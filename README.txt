This is assignment 1
I believe everything has been correctly implemented.
All my files pass the W3C validator with no errors, but they all have 1 warning that I couldn't fix.
My friend McCall Bliss helped me with some git problems I had.
I spent about 5 hours doing this assignment (I already had a resume)
